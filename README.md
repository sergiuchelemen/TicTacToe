## About
This application is a simple GUI-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, written in Kotlin. It provides a modern and user-friendly interface for playing the game with two players on a 3x3 board.

## Key Features

* Two-player gameplay: two users take turns marking empty cells on a 3x3 board with their symbols ("X" or "O").
* Input validation: the program ensures that players can only make valid moves (i.e., select an empty cell).
* Game logic: the program detects when a player has won the game (by placing three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal) or when the board is full and the game is a tie.
* Replayability: the program allows the players to restart the game after a win or a tie.
